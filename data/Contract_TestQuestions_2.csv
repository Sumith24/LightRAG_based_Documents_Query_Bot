This table outlines the tax liability, the responsible party, and the remedy for three different scenarios: tax on the sale or transfer of an aircraft, international customs duties, and penalties for late tax payments. The tax liability for the sale or transfer of an aircraft is 11% of the aircraft's value, and the Lessor is responsible for paying this tax, with the Lessee indemnifying the Lessor. International customs duties are the responsibility of the Lessee, who must pay them immediately. Penalties for late tax payments are also the responsibility of the Lessee, who must pay the penalties and any accompanying interest.
